# Author Prediction Using Deep Learning Models
 In total, six different machine learning models are created: Feedforward Neural Network with original text, Feedforward Neural Network with grammatical structure, Convolutional Neural Network with original text, Convolutional Neural Network with grammatical structure, LSTM Recurrent Neural Network with original text, and LSTM Recurrent Neural Network with grammatical structure. The performance accuracies of the training, validation and test sets are compared for all six models.
